# AudioLink for CVR
A CVR port for Audio Link.
The AudioLink shader is the same, I only provide some nice prefabs ready to use.
To get the latest unity package, head to releases and download the latest release unity package.

## Usage
1. Download **newest CCK** from here [ABI CCK](https://developers.abinteractive.net/cck/setup/)
2. Drag the **AudioLinkAIO** prefab into your scene
3. Assign a audio source to the **CVR Audio Material Parser** component (**Source Audio**)
4. Position the **ControlBox** somewhere in your world
5. Upload!

For issues or bugs with my port, you can either create a issue on github or reach out to me on discord.
